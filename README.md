## EXPERIMENTER DECK HEADS or TAILS? PROJECT TWO

![]()

This project adds a further 9 parts to the HEE HAW SIREN to make our 2-LED readout "HEADS OR TAILS". You must complete the HEE HAW first and have it operating correctly before starting this project. This way you are testing your workmanship in stages...its no good completing a project to find it doesn't work.  

## THE ORIGIN OF HEADS OR TAILS 
In days gone by, players would toss a penny to see who would commence playing a game. This custom is still carried on in cricket. When pennies were in full circulation, one of the simplest games in the world used a penny as the sole betting medium. Although highly illegal, groups or sharp, daring punters would gather behind deserted buildings to play what they called "the fairest game in the world" ; TWO-UP. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-up

It consisted of tossing a penny in the air and while it is spinning high above their heads, a punter would place a bet on it landing on the ground either heads or tails. A penny was used not only for its large size but because they knew the chances of it landing heads was exactly 50%. Since there aren't any pennies around today, (and 20c coins are just "not the same") you can make your own heads or tails predictor with the aid of electronics and learn about the laws of chance.
